# Sensor pH DIYMORE 4502C

## Description

Welcome to my project! This project is part of my undergraduate project to building pH Sensor using 4502C and to callibrate it by using Arduino UNO R3 so that it will applicable into real life measurement especially in farming industry. This repo is for users to understand that I build this using C++ and outsource application such as Arduino IDE.

For better understanding it, please kindly check my medium article [here](https://raaflahar.medium.com/ph-4502c-sensor-diymore-how-to-use-and-calibrate-using-arduino-uno-r3-3afc2b96631)

## Feature

This project has two parts,

1. Code, this is the code to voltage measurement for the callibration part and the code for the sensor.
2. Fritzing App Documentation, to understand build in diagram inside the pH 4502.
